	k. RecordsPerPage - the total records to display per page
	l. EnableHideOnNoQuery - the module will be automatically hidden when no query template is defined
	m. EnableHideOnNoResults - the module will be automatically hidden when no results are found after executing the template query
	n. EnableMultipleColumnSorting - when True, all columns are tracked for sort, when false, only one column is allowed at a time
	o. EnablePageSelection - displays the Page selection in non Ajax mode
	p. EnableQueryDebug - begins logging the debug of the current request from this action on for all users
	q. EnableQueryDebugAdmin - begins logging the debug of the current request from this action on for admin users
	r. EnableQueryDebugEdit - begins logging the debug of the current request from this action on for edit users
